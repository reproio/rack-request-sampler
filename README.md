# Rack::RequestSampler

Rack middleware for sampling requests with the specified rate and handling it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rack-request-sampler'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-request-sampler

## Usage

When you want to handle the requests that are 30% of whole requests,

```ruby
use Rack::RequestSampler

Rack::RequestSampler.config.on_sampled(ratio: 0.3) do |env|
  # Write the code to be applied to the sampled request
end
```

If you want to pick up requests in the multiple conditions, 

```ruby
use Rack::RequestSampler

Rack::RequestSampler.config.on_sampled(ratio: 0.3) do |env|
  # processed first
end

Rack::RequestSampler.config.on_sampled(ratio: 1/7r) do |env| # you can use Rational
  # processed second
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
